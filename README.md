# homepage
The homepage I use

## Configuration:
To set up the basic version of this homepage, you must do the following:

* Create a music folder in the folder where the repository has been cloned and all the music you want to this folder
* Edit the songs variable in `js/greet.js` to reflect all music used -- note: music must use the .mp3 extension for this to work and the names in the songs variable must be the name of the file minus the .mp3 file extension.
* Change the `<h1>` in `index.html` to your name, alias, or whatever message you want the script to display
* Do this again with the `<div id="who">`.
* In `js/greet.js`, change the output of the `ls` and `find` commands to suit your needs.
